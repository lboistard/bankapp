### Bank APP
The idea of this small app is to provide an api (then a frontend later) to manage personnal finances.

#### Backend
Backend is build with `bun` and `koa`. API documentation is made with `tsoa` and `swagger-ui`.
The `.env` configuration is located in `src/config/config.ts`

Only a credit agricole lib is available.

#### frontend
